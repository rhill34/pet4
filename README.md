# IT 328 Pair Program: Pets IV Sticky Forms

For this pair program, you will incorporate “sticky forms” into your **pets** project.

## Project Setup

We will be copying the pets3 project and repository to a pets4 project and repository. To do this, we create a brand new repository, clone it, and copy everything from the old project to the new project.

Begin by deciding which team member’s pets3 project you will be using as a starting point. That team member should:

1\. Log in to GitHub and create a new repo called pets4

2\. Add the partner as a collaborator

3\. Clone the repo to your 328 directory

4\. Download the project directory to your local drive

5\. Copy all of the files from pets3 to pets4 _on local_ (You can do this from within the editor, and using your File Manager)

6\. Edit composer.json and install composer

7\. Test in the browser

8\. Add, commit, and push the controller (index.php), view and model directories, .htaccess, and composer.json

That partner can now:

1\. Accept the invitation to collaborate

2\. Log in to GitHub and copy the pets4 repository URL

3\. Clone the repo to your 328 directory

4\. Download the project directory to your local drive

5\. Install composer

6. ![Image result for giraffe clipart](images/ppPic.png) Test in the browser

Take turns completing the steps below. For each step, test your code, and then add, commit and push your changes. When you trade off, don’t forget to do a git pull and then download to local before beginning the next step!

## Sticky Forms

1\. On the first form, add a Quantity field. Display an error message for a quantity that  
is empty, non-numeric, or less than one. Make your form sticky.

2\. On the second form, add a set of checkboxes. You can decide what these represent,  
and determine your own validation rules. Make your form sticky.
